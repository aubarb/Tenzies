I have an Array of 10 objects : {value: number, isHeld: false}
The array is created in Appjs
The array is iterated over in Dice.js to render 10 <Die /> components with object values as parameters
Individual die is rendered in Die.js.

Improvements
- Put real dots on the dice (CSS)
- Track the Time it took to win
- Better CSS overall
    - Animation when winning
    - Better button display
