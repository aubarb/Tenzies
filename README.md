# Tenzies

Tenzies is a little dice game

## Description

This app is enabling users to play a simple dice game where they can launch dice, hold the ones they want and re-launch... all this until they manage to get all dice with a similar value.

The goal of this project was to put my JS and React knowledge into practice, along with a neat and simple design. 

I used HTML, CSS, JS and React to make this app. Some challenges faced during the project include the different state management along with user generated events.
